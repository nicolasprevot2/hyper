# Serenade for Hyper

## Code with voice

Serenade is the fastest and easiest way to write code with natural speech. Give your hands a break without missing a beat.

Edit code, run terminal commands, and write documentation entirely with voice. Whether you have an injury or youâ€™re looking to prevent one, Serenade can help you be just as productive without lifting a finger. Use voice alongside your existing workflow, or abandon your keyboard entirely.

## Development

### macOS

1. Clone this repo, and run `ln -s <absolute path to this repository> ~/.hyper_plugins/local/hyper-serenade` to create a symlink.
1. Run `yarn` to get dependencies, then `yarn watch` to build.
1. Change Hyper's configuration with:
    - towards the bottom, `localPlugins`:
       ```
       localPlugins: [
         "hyper-serenade"
       ],
       ```
1. After a rebuild, you should quit Hyper and restart, or do View > Full Reload.
1. Optionally, use `command + option + I` to open Hyper's developer tools, which should show `Plugin serenade-hyper (x.y.z) loaded.` along with any messages from the plugin.
1. Optionally, run `rm -rf ~/.hyper.js ~/.hyper_plugins/` to remove previously installed configuration and plugins.

### Windows

1. Clone this repo to `~\AppData\Roaming\Hyper\.hyper_plugins\local\hyper-serenade`. `AppData` is a hidden folder.
1. Since symlinks may not work on Windows, also clone `https://github.com/serenadeai/editor-shared` and replace the `src/shared` symlink here with the contents of `editor-shared/src`.
1. Run `yarn` to get dependencies, then `yarn watch` to build.`
1. Optionally, run `rm -rf ~/AppData/Roaming/Hyper/` to remove previously installed configuration and plugins.

## Publishing

1. Update the version number in `package.json`.
1. Run `yarn` and `yarn build`.
1. Run `npm publish`.
